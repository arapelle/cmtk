# Concept

This CMake ToolKit (CMTK) provides helping CMake functions to manage simple C++ CMake projects easily.
It is used by the [cmtkgen](https://github.com/arapelle/cmtkgen) tools which generate start-up C++ projects.

See [task board](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/Xn4YJC5qdgApg_KM) for future updates and features.

<u>Current version</u>: 0.4.2

# Requirements #
- ### Binaries:

  - CMake 3.16 or later

# Modules

- ### Project

  - ##### check_cmake_binary_dir()

    Check if the build directory is not a subdirectory of the source directory. If it is the case, a message is printed, and the configure phase is stopped.

  - ##### set_build_type_if_undefined()

    Set Release as value for BUILT_TYPE, if none was provided.

  - ##### generate_basic_package_config_file(package_config_file  export_names)

    Generate a basic config file *package_config_file* for the package which include a CMake file for each *export_name* provided.

  - ##### install_cmake_uninstall_script(install_cmake_package_dir)

    Add installation code which creates a uninstall CMake script of the project. 
    
    - [ALL] : A uninstall script of a project will remove only the installed project files. This option forces to include all installed files in the uninstall script. (It is generally used by a super project which has subprojects (like git submodules), calling themselves this CMake function, to uninstall all subprojects files.

- ### CppProject

  - ##### generate_version_header([INPUT_VERSION_HEADER version.hpp.in] OUTPUT_VERSION_HEADER version.hpp)

    Generate a C++ header file providing C-Macro giving the version of the project. If INPUT_VERSION_HEADER is not provided, a default contents is created.

  - ##### generate_default_version_header(version_file)

    Generates a C++ header file providing C-Macro giving the version of the project with default contents.

    - [ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY *output_dir*] : 	Output directory of the built static library.
    - [BUILT_TARGETS *built_targets_var*] : 	Variable to set with the names of the built targets.

    - SOURCES *source_list*: 	List of input sources of the target.
    
  - ##### add_cpp_honly_library(library_name ...)
  
    Create a C++ header only library target.
